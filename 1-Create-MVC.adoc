=== Create MVC

In this Lab we will look at how create a Model-View-Controller and access the model.

*Step 1: Creating a Controller*

After completing this section, have your application in Full-Stack:

*Controller* can work without a *View* or *Model* and that's the place where the business logic will be found.

1. Right Click on `grails-app`
2. Select `New` -> `Grails Controller` -> Name `Inventory`

Console:
****
|Created grails-app/controllers/devtester/grails/openshift/InventoryController.groovy
|Created src/test/groovy/devtester/grails/openshift/InventoryControllerSpec.groovy
****

*Note:* you can observe the test class that was generated for this controller `InventoryControllerSpec.groovy`

3. Within your `InventoryController.groovy`

****
class InventoryController {

    def index() {
        render "Here is a list of everything."
    }
}
****

4. Run the application and you should see your first available controller

*Note:* you can also browse directly - http://localhost:8080/inventory/index
